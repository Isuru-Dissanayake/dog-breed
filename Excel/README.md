This folder contains the necessary excel files needed in this project. They are as follows,

	breedlabels – breeds as a number from 0 to 119 (a unique number for each breed)
	dogbreeds – 120 dog breed names
	labels – labels for all the training images

The code to generate the breedlabels and dogbreed file is given in this repo

# dog-breed

### Intro

This is an attempt to create a dog breed identification mobile application using neural networks. The famous Kaggle dog breed classification dataset is used here to train and test the model. Basically, there are two significant steps in this project.
1.  Training and testing neural network
2.  Mobile application development

The main focus here is to create a neural network to classify the dog in to there breeds. The mobile app development is just for experimenting.
